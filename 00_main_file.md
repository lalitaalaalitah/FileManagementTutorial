# Course Title: File Management and Organization Best Practices

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:
1. Organize files in a clear and logical folder tree structure.
2. Name files and directories following a standardized convention that includes numbering and dates.
3. Set up OneDrive for automatic saving and synchronization.
4. Save all documents in the latest file format for better compatibility.

## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to File Management
   - [**Importance of organized file structures**](./01_importance_of_file_management.md)
   - [**Benefits of standardizing file names and formats**](./02_benefits_of_file_management.md)

### 2. Organizing Files in a Tree Structure
   - **What is a Tree Structure?**
     - [Explanation of a hierarchical file organization system](./03_define_tree_structure.md)
     - [Examples of tree structures: folders for Projects, Departments, or Years](./04_examples_of_tree_structure.md)
   - **Best Practices for Folder Organization**
     - [Use meaningful, concise names for folders](./05_what_name_to_choose.md)
     - [Use subfolders to logically categorize files](./06_gradually_more_cocise_names_for_subdirs.md)
     - [Avoid spaces in file and folder names; instead, use underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`)](07_no_spaces_or_special_chars.md)
     - [**Include Preceding Numbers in Folder And File Names**](./08_add_numbers.md)
       - Use two-digit numbering at the beginning of folder names to maintain order (e.g., `01_Reports`, `02_Data`, `03_Archive`)
   - **Exercise**: Create a folder structure for a hypothetical project, e.g., `00_Project_X` with subfolders like `01_Data`, `02_Reports`, and `03_Presentations`

### 3. File Naming Conventions
   - **Standard File Naming Rules**
     - Avoid spaces; use underscores or dashes
     - **Include Dates at the End of File Names**
       - Append the date in `YYYYMMDD` format at the end of the file name for easy sorting (e.g., `2023_Financial_Report_Q1_20241106.docx`)
     - **Use Two-Digit Numbering for Folder Names**
       - Number each folder with a preceding two-digit number to maintain order
   - **Avoid Special Characters**
     - Stick to letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores for compatibility
   - **Exercise**: Rename files and folders using the conventions: preceding numbers for folders, underscores/dashes, and dates in `YYYYMMDD` format for files

### 4. Configuring OneDrive for Automatic Save
   - **Setting Up OneDrive Auto-Save**
     - Walkthrough of setting up OneDrive on Windows and macOS
     - **Enable Auto-Save**: Ensuring all files are saved automatically
   - **Sync Settings**
     - How to enable automatic synchronization across devices
     - Troubleshooting common issues with OneDrive sync
   - **Exercise**: Set up OneDrive on your computer and configure auto-save for a set of folders

### 5. Saving Files in the Latest Formats
   - **Why Use the Latest Formats?**
     - Compatibility with current software
     - Security improvements in newer formats (e.g., `.docx`, `.xlsx`)
   - **Updating Existing Files to Latest Format**
     - Open each file in the latest version of Microsoft Office and save as `.docx`, `.xlsx`, etc.
   - **Batch Conversion Tools (Optional)**
     - Introduce batch conversion tools if participants have many older files to convert
   - **Exercise**: Save or convert sample files to the latest formats, with file names including the date and numbering conventions

## Assessment and Practical Exercise
1. **Tree Structure Creation**: Participants create a folder structure for a sample project, using two-digit numbering at the start of each folder name.
2. **File Renaming and Formatting**: Rename files to follow the naming convention (no spaces, ending with date in `YYYYMMDD` format).
3. **OneDrive Auto-Save Setup**: Verify that their OneDrive is configured for automatic save and syncing.
